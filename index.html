    <h1> Among Us Project</h1>
    <h2 span style="font-weight:bolder">Introduction</h2>
    <br>
Among Us is a popular multiplayer video game for up to 10 people. It is available as a free mobile app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&amp;hl=en_US">android</a> and <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404>IOS</a> or it is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">desktop ($4.99)</a>. Each game contains 4 to 10 players on a virtual spacecraft where there are 1-3 &#8220;impostors&#8221; and everyone else is a &#8220;crewmate.&#8221; Each player has a username and is represented by a different colored avatar. During gameplay, while crewmates are trying to carry out tasks throughout the ship, impostors may stealthily kill crewmates and use vents to quickly transport themselves throughout the ship. Crewmates may be able to identify an impostor if they witness them killing another player or traveling through a vent (venting). Players who are killed by impostors or who are ejected from the ship are then excluded from the main gameplay, but continue the game as ghosts where they can watch the game unfold, perform tasks to help the crew win, and chat with other dead players.</br>
<br>
Players can have meetings when someone presses either the &#8220;emergency meeting&#8221; or &#8220;dead body report&#8221; buttons. In these meetings, players can chat with each other and then vote to eject (vote out) another player. If someone receives a majority of votes, they are ejected into space by the rest of the crew. The goal for crewmates is to identify and eject the impostor, but the impostor(s) may try to sabotage the process and persuade the crew to accuse and eject an innocent crewmate.</br>
<br>
The nature of the game typically inspires paranoia and confusion throughout the crew. Actions that could be carried out by either an impostor or a crewmate like traveling alone, reporting a dead body, being too quiet, or making accusations may be deemed &#8220;sus&#8221; by the rest of the crew.</br>
<br>
While skills in navigating the ship, completing tasks, and maintaining an awareness of surroundings are valuable in Among Us, the game is largely based on social and psychological elements. Crewmates must balance relying on mutual trust with a healthy suspicion of other players in order to work together to sniff out an impostor. Even experienced players can be fooled by impostors, or wrongly accused of being an impostor themselves. People who play regularly with groups of close friends may begin to identify patterns and tells, developing their skills based on what they know about fellow players and their techniques.</br>

<br>
      <strong>The Vent System</strong>:</br>
      - Admin, cafeteria, and the hallway above shields are connected.</br>
      - Electrical, MedBay, and security are connected.</br>
      - Weapons and shields are connected to navigation.</br>
      - The upper engine and lower engine are connected to the reactor.</br>
      <br>
      <strong>The Visual Tasks</strong>: Visual Tasks are Tasks that other players can see being performed. Seeing someone do a Visual Task is proof that they are not an Impostor since Impostors can't do any tasks. Visual effects for tasks can be turned off by the host in the game options. There are Four visual Tasks in Skeld Map:</br>
      - Empty Garbage (Storage)</br>
      - Clear Asteroids (In Weapons)</br> 
      - Submit Scan (Med Bay)</br>
      - Prime Shields (Shields)</br>

      <br>
      <br>
      One of them is to lockdown a room (to shut a room's door), that will delay the crew’s progress or prevent them from escape. Upper Engine, Lower Engine, Security, MedBay, Electrical, Cafeteria, and Storage can all be locked down.</br>
<br>
You can also set off the Reactor, which will kill the crew if not disabled in time, turn off the O2 which will suffocate them if not fixed, turn off the lights to impair vision, or take out the communications to disable the security cameras.</br>

  <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#multiCollapsePolus" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapsePolus">The Polus Map</a>
 
</p>
<div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapsePolus">
      <div class="card card-body">
           Polus&#x2019; is a large, snowy planet with 15 rooms and is the largest map in Among Us. Walking around this map is a little different the others, as it features a large, open space in the middle.&#xA0;Some of the key differences are: </br>
      - Polus is the only map without a cafeteria, as The Skeld and MIRA HQ both have cafeterias, and it is replaced by the Office.</br>
      - The doors do not open automatically, they can be opened when interacting. There are four disabled buttons, which, when pressing them, will open the door.
      - Security is similar to The Skeld; however, the difference is that it consists of only one screen, and players must change the camera view by pressing the buttons, and the cameras have an even greater field of view than that of The Skeld, which allows players to see inside the corridors, something that didn't appear on previous maps.</br>
      - The Reactors on this map are called Seismic Stabilizers; however, they still use the Reactor icon. </br>
      - Vents appear as holes in the ground.</br>
      <br>
      <strong>The structure: </strong>: This map has 15 rooms:</br>
          <br>
     <strong>1. Boiler Room:</strong> It is a room encompassed in O2. It has many wires at the walls and a water jug. It has two task:</br>
      - Replace Water Jug: Fill up a water jug by holding down the button until all of the water is transferred from the jug's right side to the left.</br>
      - Open Water Ways: The first two parts of this task are both in the Boiler Room, and involve the valves at the bottom of the room. Click each in turn, and spin them until the water bar at the side rises.</br>
      <br>
      <strong>2. Communications:</strong> This room is located near Weapons. It is a small room with a small table and a big screen to Upload Data, and a WiFi Panel at the left to Reboot Wifi when having the Task. It has two tasks:</br>
      - Upload Data: Click upload data and wait until this process complete. It takes around 8.7 seconds complete.</br>
      - Reboot Wifi: Find the communication box. The screen will read "Reboot Required." The player must pull the lever, which will begin a 60-second countdown process. The Wi-Fi will power off, and the "Tasks" tab will display the remaining amount of seconds left in the countdown, along with the screen. After the countdown reaches 0, the crewmate must return to Communications to pull the lever back up to power on the Wi-Fi. This will complete the task.</br>
     <br>
      <strong>3. Dropship:</strong> The Dropship is the main spawn point for players when they start the match, which is practically the lobby of a match before starting it. It has two tasks:</br>
      - Chart Course: Click the pad to the left of the back door. Drag the ship along the dotted course.</br>
      - Insert Key - Click the panel to the right of the back door to bring up the key slots. Select the glowing one, then click again to turn the key.</br>
      <br>
      <strong>4. Electrical:</strong> electrical is an upside-down L-shaped room at the top-left corner of the map. It has an exterior section that contains the actual electrical equipment. Under that is vent. It has a door at the top-right of it that leads outside, a door at the bottom of it that leads to O2, and a doorway at the top-left that leads to Security. It has two tasks:</br>
      - Upload Data: Click the panel to the right of the back window and select ‘upload’. After this, follow the yellow arrow to Communications to transfer the data.</br>
      - Fix Wiring: Click the panel to the left of the back window, then match up the wires using the right colors. After this, you’ll need to head to the back wall as you enter O2 and the toilets in Laboratory to finish the task.</br>
      <br>
      <strong>5. Laboratory:</strong> The Laboratory on Polus is a massive room encompassing several smaller rooms. In its center is the main laboratory room. Right below are bathrooms, which have a vent inside one of the stalls, leading directly outside and indirectly into the office. On the left are both the weather station and the laser drill pod. Each features several tasks connected to a hallway right below them, which is the left entrance to the labs. The entrance and the drill pod have a camera right outside. On the right, there is a small Medbay featuring a scanner. Right below is the upper decontamination room (its entrance facing the bathrooms), which leads to the Specimen Room. It has three tasks:</br>
      - Record Temperature: The thermostat will be in front of you as you enter. Click it and change the temperature on the left until it matches the one on the right.</br>
      - Repair Drill: Select the drill in the outer corner of the Laboratory. You’ll need to keep clicking on the four red corners until they disappear.</br>
      - Align Telescope: Click the telescope, then move it around until you find the object highlighted in the bottom corner.</br>
     <br>
       <strong>6. Medbay:</strong> Otherwise, it's encompassed by the Laboratory. It contains a scanner and hospital beds. The beds look like they have a table next to them. It also has two tasks:</br>
       - Inspect Sample: Select the sample tray at the back on MedBay, then get ready to wait 60 seconds for it to process. During this time, you should go and do another task. Once time is up, head back and select the odd sample out.</br>
       - Submit Scan: Stand on the platform in the MedBay and click for the the scan to begin.</br>
     <br>

Exterior (Outside):</strong> The exterior is the outer area of the planetary base, being located practically from the right exit of the Office, with a lava pit, several pilasters of climatic modules, among other things. There is a metal plank leading out to the lava, which is used to vote off and kill suspected impostors during the ejection scene. However, whilst playing, players cannot fall into the lava. This area can also be seen in the security cameras. It has two tasks:</br>
     - Weather Nodes - There are several weather nodes outside, some near the top, some near the bottom, and some more central. Use the map to see where the broken one is, then click it and drag the current through the maze. After this, head to the left side of the Laboratory to complete the calibration.</br>
     - Record Temperature - Head down to the bottom right by the pool of lava. Click the panel next to it and change the temperature on the left until it matches the temperature on the right.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>10. Specimen room:</strong> The Specimen Room is located near the bottom right of the map. To access it, you have to pass through one of the small Decontamination rooms in either Admin or the Laboratory, then walk through a long empty hallway. The room features windows that let you see the exterior from inside. It has four tasks:</br>
     - Start Reactor: This is the bulky terminal on the back wall. Click it then repeat the flashing pattern five times.</br>
     - Upload Data: This is on the right hand side as soon as you enter from the Laboratory. Once this part is finished, you need to head to Communications.</br>

The camera consists of only one screen, and players must change the camera view by pressing the buttons, and the cameras have an even greater field of view than that of The Skeld, which allows players to see inside the corridors.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>14. Admin:</strong> In Polus map, Admin room is much bigger and features no task. It features the same Admin table as The Skeld, which here can be used on either side. It has a vent on the left-bottom corner, in a corridor-like formation, which leads directly outside the left wall or far off near the Laboratory entrance. Right below the Admin table is one of the two entrances to the Specimen Room.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>15. Decontamination:</strong>: In Polus, there are two decontamination rooms in the map, each on either side of two hallways that extend out from the Specimen Room, one that goes up to the Laboratory, and one that goes left and down to Admin. They are tiny, square-shaped rooms and the one near the Laboratory has an electrical panel for the Fix Wiring task.</br>
     <br>
              <br>
              <br>
      <strong>The vent system</strong>:While still called vents, in Porus its actually holes in the ground as mentioned above, though access remains restricted to Impostors only. There are a few interconnected systems, with their pathways described below: </br>
- Office - Storage - Outside (near Communications)</br>
- O2 - Electrical - Outside (near Electrical)</br>
- Outside (left of Dropship) - Outsider (right of Dropship)</br>
- Laboratory - Outside (near Laboratory) - Admin - Outside (near Admin)</br>
      <br>
      <strong>Visual Task</strong>:visual tasks are tasks that other players can see being performed. Seeing someone do a Visual Task is proof that they are not an Impostor since Impostors can't do any tasks. Visual effects for tasks can be turned off by the host in the game options. In Polus Map, only 1 visual task which is med bay scan.</br>

     - Fuel Engines: click the terminal on the left until the gas canister comes up. Hold down the bottom button until the engine is full.</br>
     - Run Diagnostics: use the console on the left and begin the task. It will take a long time, almost a minute, for this to go through. You can leave the terminal and come back, but the task will not register as complete until you select it one final time to choose the anomaly.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>9. Medbay:</strong> It is the place where sick people reside. It consists of beds with a scanner and a vent between two beds. It has one Visual task:</br>

     <br>
     <strong>10. Office:</strong> In Mira HQ map, the office is a medium-sized room located at the end of the North Hallway, across from Admin. It has a "The Henry Stickmin Collection" poster at the top right corner. It is in the upper area of the map. It has a vent in the upper left corner. The lights and one part of the comms sabotages can be fixed there. It has one task:</br>
     - Process Data: select the computer at the back of the room, then wait while the data uploads itself.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>11. Reactor:</strong> In MIRA HQ map, the reactor is connected to the Laboratory, which contains a massive reactor with a claw that emits a laser (which can change color if the reactor is sabotaged), several computers, and two hand palms that are used to repair the sabotage of the reactor, just like on The Skeld. But, to get to the reactor, Crewmates must first go through Decontamination. A vent is located on the left below. It has three tasks:</br>
     - Start Reactor: go up to the actual reactor in the middle of the room. Once clicked, it’s a simple case of following the sequence of flashes until you’ve done this five times.</br>
     - Unlock Manifold: click the keypad on the left of the room, then tap the numbers 1-10 in sequence.</br>
     - Divert Power To: select the control panel, and then flip the switch to divert power to whichever room you need. From there, you just need to find the panel (the yellow arrow will guide you) and flip the connector in the center.</br>  
     <br>
     <strong>12.Storage:</strong> In this map, Storage is located near the Cafeteria. Inside the room is a bookcase which contains old materials, including the watering can, which is used to water the plants. It has one task:</br>
     - Water Plants: first, you need to select the watering can at the back of the room. This will bring up a new screen, where you’ll need to, um, click the watering can again. After this, head to the Greenhouse and click the plants on the right to finish the task.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>13. Decontamination:</strong> It is where the crew members are decontaminated before going to the corridor that connects the Reactor and the Laboratory. It consists of an isolated room with yellow floors and black floors that flash blue, in addition to vaporizers and two doors that players can open by pressing the button on the side. When they enter, the door closes, and the place emits steam, and after that, the other door opens. It doesnt' have any tasks.</br>
     <br>
     <strong>14. Hallway:</strong> The hallway is Y-shaped and has doorlog sensors at each of its exits. At its bottom right, there is a vent. The hallway is one of the busiest locations on the MIRA HQ map, so it is risky for An Impostor to kill there. However, by using the vent at the bottom right correctly, it is possible to escape after a kill. It has one task:</br> 
     - Fix Wiring: click the panel then line up the wires across either side by matching the colors. After this, you’ll need to head to the Greenhouse and to the Reactor to finish the task.</br>
     <br>
      <strong>The vent system</strong>: The vents on MIRA HQ are interconnected, meaning that an Impostor can use them to travel around the map more efficiently, unlike other maps. This makes venting a very efficient strategy for Impostors, as they can kill someone and appear pretty much anywhere else on the map.</br>
